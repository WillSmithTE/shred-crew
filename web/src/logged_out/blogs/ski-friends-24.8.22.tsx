            The ski hill is an intimidating place. It's crowded, loud, and full of people who know what they're
            doing—which means you probably don't. But don't worry: You can still make friends on the slopes
            if you follow these simple steps.

        <Typography paragraph>
            Ask the locals for advice. If you’re going to be spending a lot of time in one place, chances are there are some people who live their lives there and know more than you do. They can tell you where to go and what to do, as well as give you tips on safety and etiquette.
            <br /><br />
            The bartender is always an excellent resource for information about the area. He or she will have lived in the area for years and seen many different faces come through—they know what works and what doesn't with newcomers!
            <br /><br />
            The ski patrol provides first aid services on the slopes, but they also provide important information about conditions at various resorts during any given period throughout the season. You might not think of them as an authority figure until something goes wrong (like falling down), but it's always good to keep track of where these guys are during your stay so that if something does happen (and it eventually will), they're right around when needed most."

            Learn about the geography.
        </Typography>
        <Typography paragraph>

            Knowing the geography of your mountain is key to getting to know the people around you.
            <br /><br />
            The terrain, runs, lifts and snow conditions of your mountain will affect the way skiers move about it. These factors can make it easy or difficult for you to meet other people. For example, if there are only a few chairs on all but one lift, you may want to spend more time in that area so that other skiers have an opportunity to notice you while waiting in line!
            <br /><br />
            Asking questions like “how long has this run been open?” and “what’s your favorite run?” are good conversation starters with locals when they inevitably ask what part of town (or state) you're visiting from!

        <Typography paragraph>
            The best way to make friends is by being friendly. Come up with a plan and then execute it, whether it's asking people to help you, teach you something or show you around the city. It may seem simple but it can be difficult to put yourself out there.
            <br /><br />
            You should also ask people questions about themselves and listen carefully when they answer them. Don't dismiss their responses as unimportant or irrelevant; if someone tells you they like dogs but not cats, don't make fun of them for that! Their answer might seem strange at first but if he/she is making an effort to share something personal with you then make sure that in return for their trust and honesty that the two of you can continue talking about your interests together over time (and maybe get some free food too).

            Apres! Apres! Apres!
        </Typography>
        <Typography paragraph>
            Apres ski is a tradition and celebration. It’s a reason to go skiing, and an excuse to make friends.
            <br /><br />
            Apres is a party with music, drinks, laughter and dancing at the base of the mountain. It’s also what you do when you get home after a full day of skiing or snowboarding. If you want to take advantage of all your favorite things about apres (the booze, the music and dancing), without having your first day on trails cut short by fatigue or hunger, try some of the naturally hydrating powder waiting for you outside.

            Get a crew.
        </Typography>
        <Typography paragraph>

            Get a crew. If you’re looking to meet new people, finding a crew is the best way to do it. A “crew” can be any group of people who are connected by something they enjoy doing together: family members, friends, coworkers or neighbors. Being part of a crew means that you always have someone to go with when making plans and activities. Some crews might be organized around one specific activity (e.g., hiking), while others are more casual and loosely organized around multiple activities (e.g., going out for dinner).
            <br /><br />

            Soon you'll be able to find a group on the Shred Crew app. If you haven't already, sign up now to be an early tester and get a sneak peek.

            Start your own crew.

        <Typography paragraph>
            Start your own crew. If you're looking to make friends at the snow and you don't have any friends at snow, then it might be time to start your own crew. The first thing you'll need to do is decide on the right size for your crew. This depends a lot on where you live and what kind of equipment is available, but if you can't come up with a good answer then just go with three people: two guys plus one girl.

            When at a ski hill, make friends by drinking, following locals, and shouting "apres!"
        </Typography>
        <Typography paragraph>
            When at a ski hill, make friends by drinking. Locals and other skiers have been drinking all day on the mountain and will be eager to tell you about their exploits, so get in on the discussion.
            <br /><br />
            You can also use this opportunity to ask about local trivia, like where the best après-ski spots are or who's doing what for apres that night.
